#Spelling Checker
This program checks the spelling of all English words by using a dictionary.txt file that contains a long list of all the english words in alphabetical order. When a user inputs an English word, the program scans the dictionary text file for the word and if a match is returned then this indicates a correct spelling, otherwise it indicates a mispelled or unlisted word.
